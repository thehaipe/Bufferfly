# 🚀 Release Notes: Bufferly v.0.2.Alpha

This update focuses on system integration and customization. We've refined how Bufferly lives within macOS, making it feel more like a native extension of your workflow.

### ✨ Major Features
* **Exclusive Menu Bar Presence:** Bufferly now lives exclusively in the status bar (tray). The Dock icon is hidden to keep your workspace clean and focused.
* **Custom Global Hotkeys:** You are no longer limited to presets! Head over to `Settings > Keybindings` to record any custom shortcut that fits your flow.
* **Permissions Health Check:** Added a status indicator in General Settings to verify **Accessibility** permissions. This ensures the clipboard overlay always appears on top of other apps.

### 🎨 UI & UX Improvements
* **Native Settings Experience:** Rebuilt the Settings UI to follow the **macOS Human Interface Guidelines**. No more transparent margins or window focus issues.
* **History Limit Slider:** Replaced the dropdown menu with a precise slider. You can now set your clipboard history limit between **10 and 50 items** with ease.
* **Smart Focus Management:** Clicking "Settings" from the menu bar now correctly brings the window to the foreground, even if you are working in another full-screen application.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
* **Icon Stability:** Fixed an issue where the menu bar icon would disappear or render as a black square on certain wallpaper configurations.
* **Visual Glitches:** Resolved "transparent window" artifacts in the Settings view.
* **Support Link:** Fixed the broken "Support Author" link in the menu bar.
* **Layout Consistency:** Fixed alignment and spacing issues for links within the "About" section.
